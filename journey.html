        <h1>What is the importance of a diet?</h1>
        <p>As you might already know each person has a different ideal diet. People have different dietary needs, whethey they are looking to change their body physiques or simply aiming to become more healthy. 
            You must certainly have heard of many different diets such as low-carb diet, low-fat diet, dukan diet(high protein, low carb), supercarb diet, etc. What many people don't know, is that you can 
            break all of these different diets into macronutrients(such as protein, fiber, fat, carbohydrates) and micronutrients(vitamins and minerals). Both macronutrients and micronutrients are important
            pieces of a healthy diet. What varies from person to person is how much of each one needs to consume. Another important thing to consider when it comes to dieting is the number of calories
            (unit that measures energy) one should consume daily which also varies from person to person. <br>
            Throughout the Visualization, you will encounter  a series of bar charts of calories and the different macronutrients (proteins, carbs, and fat). I chose to order them by highest descending because Starbucks
            main products are not commonly whole meals, so the food items with the most nutritional values are the most important to observe and analyze.
