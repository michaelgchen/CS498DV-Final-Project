        <h1>Protein</h1>
		<p>Proteins are vital to our bodies, playing many critical roles such as regulation of our body tissues and organs. We need protein in our diets to repair our body cells and make new ones. For example,
            after a workout session, you create little tears in your muscle fibers and it's the rebuilding proccess (which the proteins are responsible for) that makes our muscles stronger. Generally there 
            is no such thing as a diet that is low on protein given how important they are to our body. When it comes to choosing foods you should always look at their protein content and choose the ones
            with the highest amount of proteins.</p>
            
        <p>Below is a bar chart that shows the top 40 food items that Starbucks serves to its customers with most protein. It is an horizontal bar chart with the X-axis representing the amount of protein in grams.</p>

        <p>The items with the highest protein countent are Turkey Pesto Panini, Roasted Turkey & Dill Havarti Sandwich and Turkey & Havarti Sandwich with about 34 grams of protein. One interesting thing to note is that they all have turkey breast as an ingredient
            which makes sense since Turkey Breast is a very healthy source of protein with low amount of fat, which also explains why it doesn't have as many calories as for example, the strawberry & jam sandwich. The 
            Za'atar Chicken & Lemon Tahini Salad could also be another healthy option if you are not too much into turkey! </p>
