        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>The primary message I wanted to get across with this project was to provide some guidance on which food items people can order at Starbucks while following their dietary needs. 
            With the help of these horizontal bar charts and the annotations, you can tell which Starbucks items have the highest amount of calories, proteins, carbohydrates and fats which will certainly be useful the next time
            you visit Starbucks to get some work done!  </p>
