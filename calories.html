        <h1>Calories</h1>
		<p>Calories is used as a unit of measurement, that measures the amount of energy a food or drink has. Calories in food or drink are responsible for providing energy to our body and all 
            of the tasks we do daily like studying, working out, and even sleeping. The calories we consume are also responsible for our feeling of being full after we eat something. 
            We consume calories from our food and drinks and we spend them with these different activities. Different activities 
            spend differents amount of calories. For example working out spends many more calories than sleeping. Since some people are more active than other, people also have differnet calorie needs. In general
            people that want to gain weight need to maintain a calorie surplus (consume more calories than they spend) while people that want to lose weight need to maintain a calorie deficit (spend more calories than 
            they consume). Generally, the recommended daily calorie intake is 2,000 calories a day for women and 2,500 for men. However since the average american in our modern and heavily industrialized
             society consumes more than 3600 calories daily (a) natiowide concern) the average person usually should aim for low calorie foods. </p>
    
        
        <p>Below is a bar chart that shows the top 40 food items that Starbucks serves to its customers with most calories. It is an horizontal bar chart with the X-axis representing the amount of calories in cal.</p>

        <p>As you can see the item with the most calories sold by Starbucks as of 2017, was Lentils & Vegetable Protein Bowl with Brown Rice totalling 650 calories. This food item or other calory dense items like the Green Goddess Avocado Salad and the Strawberry & Jam Sandwich
            are perfect for people that are looking to gain weight or feeling the most full. If you are looking to lose weight or want a lighter snack, perhaps look to purchase items from the bottom of this bar chart such as the BBQ Chicken Protein Box or the Roasted
             Carrot & Kale salad with about 400 calories. <br> However, it is important to note that one needs to look into other nutritional content besides calories when choosing their food,
             specially because some foods can be rich in calories but provide a very small amount of nutrients to the body. We will now dive deeper into the three most important macronutrients in the next scenes
