        <h1>Carbohydrates</h1>
		<p>Carbohydrates are the sugars, starches and fibers found in fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products. 
        Though sometimes people think carbohydrates are unhealthy they are a vital part of any diet. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of the main
         ways the body can obtain energy(in other words, calories) from food. Not all carbs are equal. Some sources of carbs such as complex carbohydrates(made with two different molecules of sugar) are healthier.
        When it comes to carbohydrates look for carbohydrates that have a low glycemic index and/or are high in fiber such as fruits and veggies.</p>
    
        <p>Below is a bar chart that shows the top 40 food items that Starbucks serves to its customers with most carbohydrates. It is an horizontal bar chart with the X-axis representing the amount of carbohydrates in grams.</p>

        <p>As you can see, the item with the most carbohydrates sold by Starbucks as of 2017, was Lentils & Vegetable Protein Bowl with Brown Rice totalling 80 carbohydrates. The Starwberry & Jam sandwich also has a high number of carbohydrates.
             Both of these are not only the items with the most calories but also the items with most carbohydrates, that perfectly makes sense since items that are rich in carbohydrates tend to be rich in calories. However as you can observe the 
             Green Goddess Avocado Salad which is very calorie dense is not that rich in carbs. Certainly another macronutrient must be compensating for that... Which is why now we will explore fats!</p>
