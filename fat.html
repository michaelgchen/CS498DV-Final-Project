        <h1>Fats</h1>
		<p>Fats or triglyceride are often viewed as unhealthy, however just like Carbs, they are also very important for our survival and diet. Fats are essential for providing us energy (typically half of the body energy needs)
             and also responsible for our cell growth. 
            When our body runs out of carbohydrates our body runs mainly on fats. Saturated fats such as fats that come from fish, olive oil and avocados are healthier than trans and unsaturated fat (such as the ones that come from ice cream and burguers)

        </p>
    
        <p>Below is a bar chart that shows the top 40 food items that Starbucks serves to its customers with most fat. It is an horizontal bar chart with the X-axis representing the amount of fat in grams.</p>

        <p>The item with the most fat sold by Starbucks as of 2017, was Green Goddess Avocado, which also explains why 
            it had so many calories in the chart of the first scene. Other items rich in fat are the Roasted Turkey Sandwich and the Chorizo & Egg Breakfast Sandwich with around 37 grams of fat.
             If you are looking for a lighter but still fullfilling food get items from the bottom of the chart such as the Almond Croissaint or the Chicken Wrap Protein Box with about 22 grams of fat.</p>
