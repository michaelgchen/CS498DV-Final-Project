        <h1>Dieting Analysis with Starbucks' items</h1>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This project analyzes how Starbucks food items can vary when it comes to their nutrient content. Its main purpose is, through a narrative visualization, to provide its viewers some guidance of which 
            items are the most suitable for their dietary needs. </p>
        
        <h3>Format</h3>
        <p>The structure of this visualization is an interactive slideshow where the user traverses through different slides(scenes) where each is a webpage. Each different slide contains a chart that 
            gives the user some information about a specific nutrient, such as calories, carbohydrates and proteins.</p>

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>The <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu">dataset</a> for this project was obtained from Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, and an online community of data scientists practicioners. It was last updated 3 years ago but many food items remain 
            the same until today so it is still very useful.</p>
